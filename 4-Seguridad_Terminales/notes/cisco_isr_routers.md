# Cisco Integrated Services Routers
Cisco ISR (Integrated Services Router) is a family of routers designed to provide a converged branch platform that integrates routing, switching, virtual server, storage, security, unified communications, WAN optimization, and performance management tools in a single device.

Here are some key features and capabilities of Cisco ISR routers:

1. Concurrent software services: Support for concurrent software services at speeds up to 2 Gbps, with a distributed multicore architecture and an internal services plane.
2. WAN optimization: Integrated WAN optimization capabilities, including compression, caching, and traffic shaping, to improve application performance and reduce WAN bandwidth requirements.
3. Security: Comprehensive security features, including firewall, intrusion prevention, antivirus, and content filtering, to protect against threats and ensure data integrity.
4. Unified communications: Support for IP PBX, Session Border Controller (SBC), and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, enabling secure and reliable voice communications.
5. Wireless: Integrated wireless LAN (WLAN) and wireless WAN (WWAN) capabilities, including 802.11ac and LTE Advanced 3.0.
6. Scalability: Modular design allows for easy upgrades and additions of services, such as WAN optimization, security, and unified communications, without requiring hardware upgrades.
7. Management: Simplified management through Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, and other tools, enabling centralized monitoring and control of the network and services.
8. Cloud connectivity: Support for cloud-based services and applications, including ThousandEyes integration for expanded visibility across the internet, cloud, and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Cisco ISR routers are designed for various environments, including:

1. Branch offices: Small to large branch offices requiring converged services, security, and WAN optimization.
2. Enterprise campuses: Large enterprise campuses requiring high-performance, secure, and scalable routing and switching.
3. Data centers: Data centers requiring high-density, secure, and scalable routing and switching for cloud and virtualized environments.

The Cisco ISR family includes various models, such as the 4000 Series, 1000 Series, and 1100 Series, each with its own set of features and capabilities.
